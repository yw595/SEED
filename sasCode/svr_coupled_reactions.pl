=head1 svr_coupled_reactions
Takes as input a table containing reaction IDs and 
adds a column giving the "adjacent" reactions.
------
Example:
    svr_all_reactions | svr_coupled_reactions > table.with.coupled.reactions
would produce a 2-column table, each a pair of reaction IDs.  There would
be redundancy, since each pair of coupled reactions would show up twice.
------
=back
=head2 Command-Line Options
=over 4
=item -c Column
This is used only if the column containing reaction IDs is not the last.

=head2 Output Format
The standard output is a tab-delimited file. It consists of the input
file with an extra column added (a reaction that is part of the set that
are considered adjacent).  Note that this implies that there will
often be multiple output lines for a single input line.
